# MediaPlayer2
A MediaPlayer, with one screen on the TV and one on a mobile device.

### How to Setup

On TV/computer:

Download the MP2 Mac app [here](https://github.com/Simas2006/MediaPlayer2/releases/latest) and install it to your Applications directory. On your first opening of the app, you will be prompted with a page to setup your password, as well as your Server ID, which will be necessary to connect to your server.

After your password is created, you will be taken with the main page. Press the "Open Folder" link, and you will be prompted with a Finder window with two subfolders, "music" and "photos". Place albums of music and photos in their respective directories, but do not leave any given album empty.

On Mobile:

Download the Expo app (if you don't have it already), and open in your browser of choice MP2's app's Expo page [here](https://expo.io/@simas06/mp2-mobile-app), and press the "Open project using Expo" button to open the app automatically. To login, enter the Server ID and Password you were given or set on the TV. You will then be sent to the main page.
