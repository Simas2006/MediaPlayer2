--- Cryptography Spec ---
All message sent to the server must be encrypted using AES with an initialization vector. Messages returned from the server must be encrypted unless their contents are "ok" or "error".
The CONN command must be in the plaintext format "CONN <the text 'mp2-authentication' encrypted using the password>".
After the DCONN command is issued, the authentication key will be considered to be invalid until it is reused with a CONN command.

--- Command Spec ---
CONN                       ; Creates an authentication key to be returned to the client to be used in place of the password in normal communications. Is the first message sent to the server. Fails if there is already a connection which has not DCONN'd yet. See the cryptography spec for details.
DCONN                      ; Deauthorizes a given connection. Is the last message sent to the server. Returns "ok" normally.
LIST  <path>               ; Lists the contents of a directory.
TYPE  <path>               ; If a directory signified by the path contains only other directories, returns "directory", otherwise, returns "file".

ADDTQ <dirpath> <filelist> ; Adds songs in the dirpath directory to the queue. Returns "ok" normally.
OPENP <path>               ; Opens a photo album. Returns the name of the first photo normally.
PREVP                      ; Goes back to the previous photo. Returns the name of the photo normally, with a suffix of "_first" if the result is the first picture.
NEXTP                      ; Goes to the next photo. Returns the name of the photo normally, with a suffix of "_last" if the result is the last picture.

HOME                       ; Returns from a subpage to the default page on the server.
WOPN  <url>                ; Opens the URL in a sandboxed browser on the server, even if a webpage is already present. Returns "ok" normally.

PLYPS                      ; Plays (or pauses) the current song. Returns "ok" normally.
PNSNG                      ; Plays the next song in the queue. If the queue is empty, will stop playing altogether. Returns the same result as GETQ.
RWIND                      ; Rewinds the current song to position 0. Returns "ok" normally.

GETQ                       ; Returns the queue with the full paths of the songs except for /music, comma-separated, with a prefix of "playing," or "paused,", depending on the current state of the playing song.
UPSQ  <index> <totop>      ; Moves the indexed song in the queue upwards one song if totop is false, and up to the top if it is true. Returns the same result as GETQ.
DWNSQ <index>              ; Moves the indexed song in the queue downward one song. Returns the same result as GETQ.
DELSQ <index>              ; Removes the indexed song from the queue. Returns the same result as GETQ.
CLRQ                       ; Clears the queue and triggers PNSNG. Returns "ok" normally.
SHFLQ                      ; Shuffles the queue. Returns "ok" normally.
